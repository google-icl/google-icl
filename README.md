# 👋 Hi, I’m @google-icl

I'm an aspiring IT specialist with one year of hands-on experience at **INSIDE**, where I worked as a **Server Administrator** managing VDS/VPS environments and gaming servers, particularly **Rust**.

## 👀 I’m interested in:
- System administration and DevOps
- Backend and full-stack development
- Game server infrastructure
- Automation and scripting

## 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- Docker & container orchestration
- Linux system internals
- Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure)
- Advanced Python (Flask, APIs)

## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Open-source infrastructure tools
- Game server hosting solutions
- Web and backend development projects

## 📫 How to reach me:

He/Him

## ⚡ Fun fact:
I’m always up for a technical challenge—and I enjoy optimizing game servers just as much as optimizing code.
